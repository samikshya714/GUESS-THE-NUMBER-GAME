# GUESS-THE-NUMBER-GAME
Guess the number game is a fun activity in which the user has to make a guess of number between the range of 1 to 100. The user has to guess the number in a given number of attempts. This was created using OOP in C++ as the group project by first year second part engineering project organized by ACES.The game also provides hints to the user indicating whether their guess is greater or smaller than the secret number they have to guess.<br/>

GAME STRUCTURES:<br/>
           The game is developed using C++ and its concepts. The game starts by generating a random number within a defined range using rand() function.The attempts is initialized to 0 
           and tracks thge number of guess made by the user. The game is played using the gameplay function :<br/>
			     user input: The player enters their name and selects the difficulty level (easy, medium or difficult).
			     difficulty choices: Based on the difficulty chosen, the player has a limited number of guesses:<br/>
				                       easy level: 10 guesses<br/>
						       medium level: 7 guesses<br/>
						       difficult level: 5 guesses<br/>
			     Guessing: The player guesses the numbers repeatedly and each guess is compared to the secred number.<br/>
		                       If the number is guessed correctly then the game logs the result to the file with the number of attempts and the player wins.<br/>
				       If the number is guessed incorrect then the player is informed if the secret number is greater or smaller than the guessed number until the number of attempts is 
                                       completed.<br/>
			     End of game: The game ends when the player either guesses the number or runs out of attempts.The results are then logged to a file named "game_results.txt" where the player name 
                                         with  umber of attempts are recorded.<br/>
			     Restart or quit: The game comtinues in a loop, allowing players to start a new game or quit by selecting appropriate options.
		                              previous scores: Before starting a new game, the previous game results are displayed from the file.<br/>

OUR EXPERIENCE:<br/>
                This game is developed by me and my team as our first C++ project. Though it has many shortcomings but we thoroughly enjoyed while working in this project. It would have 
                been even more better if there was involvement of GUI. There are many features which could make it even more interesting and attractive. BUt as our first project, we 
                gathered basic to advanced knowledge of C++. This experience might help us in our future journey as well.
